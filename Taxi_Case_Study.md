# Taxi Data Engineering Project (ELT)

ELT is preferred when the data is safe and cleaned enough to be put in a database, which means it will require less transformation. Feasibility of cloud is also a factor when choosing bewteen ELT and ETL.


## Loading

- loaded csvs for July and August Taxi data
- Similarly, for zone lookups

# Staging

 - Applied transformation like casting, relevant columns, trips with no passenger or zero fare.
 - Staged a model to combine July and August data sheets
 

## Checking staging 

```
select count(*) from dbt_zarshad_stg.stg_green_tripdata;
```

- After staging, we realised, we have too many unuseful columns.
- Business will help reduce that and simplify things for users as well as the organization

# Business Logic
- Bringing columns relevant to the user.
- Most business questions will be answered through this layer.

## Business Questions
1- *How does revenue compare between July and August?*

The revenue increases almost 1.20%.


Using trip_date
- July - 892,549.76
- August - 903285.72
```


SELECT SUM(total_amount) AS july_rev
FROM dbt_zarshad_mart.fact_combined_trips
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_date) = 7

```

    - Elmhurst
    - Bay Ridge

- Largest Increase

    - East Harlem South
    - Central Harlem
    - Jamaica

4 - *How do average tips vary by drop-off zone and month?*

- Average tips are zero in the months of 1, 6, 12 because there are no records.
- In 7, Newark Airport has the highest avg tip (14)
- In 8, Battery Park has the highest avg tip (6.12)
- In 9, 10.59 is the highest avg tip from Brooklyn Heights

```

  AVG(tip_amount) AS avg_tip,

5- *Whatâ€™s the average trip distance and fare per zone per month?*



```
SELECT 
  AVG(trip_distance) AS avg_trip_dist,
  AVG(fare_amount) AS avg_fare,
  pickup_zone,
  dropoff_zone,
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_date) AS month

  dbt_zarshad_mart.fact_combined_trips 
GROUP BY 
  dropoff_zone,
  pickup_zone,
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM trip_date);

```

6 - *Do certain pickup zones consistently generate higher tips or longer rides?*


- Longer rides could mean time or distance, for now, I am using trip distance wrt to pickup zones. 

- Longer trips and higher distance seems to be unrelated

7 - *Is there a correlation between trip distance and tip amount across months?*

```
SELECT corr(trip_distance, tip_amount),
extract(month from trip_date) as month
FROM dbt_zarshad_mart.fact_combined_trips
group by month order by month;

```
